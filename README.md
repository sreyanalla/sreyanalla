I'm fourth-year student at George Washington University studying **computer science** and **political science**. I'm currently **interning at MITRE as a Cyber SWE Intern** on a newly developed research project, but am also volunteering my programming skills as **a developer for the Environmental Defense Fund** alongside a small team (~5 others) to develop a Hazard Reporting Web-App through an organization called Develop for Good. I've always been interested in the intersection of tech, programming and public policy so I'm very excited to see what these experiences will bring!

Feel free to check out more about me and my experiences at www.sreyanalla.com or get in touch with me at sreyanalla@gwu.edu!
